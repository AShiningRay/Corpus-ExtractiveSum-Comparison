# Corpus-ExtractiveSum-Comparison

This repository contains the Corpus used to compare all Automatic Summarization Techniques present in the [ExtractiveSum-Comparison](https://github.com/AShiningRay/ExtractiveSum-Comparison) repository.

The corpus is organized as follows:

* `Corpus_CSV` -> Has opinions separated per hotel and in csv format, making it easier to select only the content that interests you.
* `Corpus_Sample_PFC1` -> Opinions sampled on the first batch of testing, where less summarizers were compared, and the overall summary size and opinion count was lower.
* `Corpus_Sample_PFC2` -> Opinions sampled on the second batch of testing,
* `Corpus_TXT` -> Contains opinions from all hotels joined into singular files for content and title, respectivelly.

This corpus is published and available under the [Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal license](LICENSE), so you are free to modify, distribute and use it under other similarly open licenses if you so wish.
